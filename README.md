**XML settings addon for standard settings - for of 0.9.x (and older)**  
Basic xml variable handling and standard features I need in nearly any project:
- getters and setters for most common variable types (no groups, though)
- Default variables in code that will be overwritten if variable is present in xml file
- optional auto-saving at setting of variable (note that variable has to be present in xml file for this function. It will not be auto-created!)
- verbose output of what's happening
- logging functionality included: log level and log type (terminal/file) can be defined through standard xml variables



How to use (also see example project):
1) inlcude and define in ofApp.h:

    - #include "ofxXmlBasedProjectSettings.h" 	on top  
    - ofxXmlBasedProjectSettings settingsXml, otherXml; 	in class  


2) in setup();

    // add XML variables: Give it a default/fallback value.  
    // On init() the XML is checked for these variables and if found default/fallback value is overridden.  
    // Standard procedure is to add all XML variables like below in setup() and later use the setter functions if those variables are altered.  
    // Please do not set a variable without having added it - it can be used and even be saved in XML (node has to be present - will not be auto-generated).  
    // But it might not be treated correctly in init().  
    settingsXml.addBoolean("flag1", true);  
    settingsXml.addInt("einint", 156);  
    settingsXml.addFloat("einefloat", 2.893);  
    settingsXml.addString("einstring", "gehMalArbeiten");  
    settingsXml.addColor("beige", ofColor(10, 23, 33, 4));  
    settingsXml.addVec2f("punkt1", ofVec2f(10, 23));  
    settingsXml.addVec3f("dreiDPunkt", ofVec3f(4, 10, 23));  
    settingsXml.addVec4f("vierdddd", ofVec4f(10, 23, 33, 4));  
  
	// to add a variable that require a setting in XML (otherwise exit on program start!) just pass an empty default value (according to the variable type)  
	settingsXml.addBoolean("requiredFlag", NULL);  
	settingsXml.addFloat("requiredFloat", NULL);  
	settingsXml.addInt("requiredInt", NULL);  
	settingsXml.addString("hintergrundBild", "");  
	settingsXml.addColor("requiredBeige", NULL);  
	// Vec2f, Vec3f and Vec4f have no "required" possibility yet (as for problems in checking if NULL/unset)  

3) in setup();

    // init the xml. The added variables will be processed  
    //  
    // Second parameter switches on debug stuff: When true, the variables "debug", "verbose" and "logToFile" will be added, which control the debug output  
    // (everything that is sent through ofLog functions). Should be used in the main/first xml object/file  
    settingsXml.init("settings.xml",true);  


    // do the same for other objects/files, but debug stuff should not be used another time (as it used for App in general it would not make any sense to do it 2 times)  

	otherXml.addInt("otherInt", 156);  
	otherXml.addVec2f("punkt1", ofVec2f(10, 23));  

	otherXml.init("otherSettings.xml");  


Then all the variables can be set in XML and are ready for use.


getting Variables:

    settingsXml.getVec2fValue("punkt1");  
    settingsXml.getStringValue("einstring");  

Please note, that there is a method for every available variable type.



setting Variables (assigning a new value):

    settingsXml.setFloatValue("einefloat", 0.4, true);  
    settingsXml.setStringValue("einstring", "mehr Ã¼ber Torf", true);  
    settingsXml.setVec4fValue("vierdddd", ofVec4f(214,12,85,45), true);  

Third property switches auto save on: Value is saved (after a short time buffer).
Please note, that there is a method for every available variable type.


// basic notes:
- Please add a node in your xml file manually for every included variable. It will not be auto-created!
- Do not start a variable name with a digit. XML will not handle this
- If you have a non-utf8 encoding involved somewhere, your XML file will get corrupted on saving when you use special characters.
- Visual Studio might have an unrecognizable non-utf8 - encoding on ofApp.cpp. Please open it in other editor (e.g. Geany) change the encoding to utf8 (even if it's showing utf8 already) and save it. Then re-open in Visual Basic and re-compile.
- ofDrawBitmapString will not properly show special characters, nore will the Command prompt - even if they are correct in our Addon.  That does not mean there is a problem - if you use a font addon like ofxFontStash all shall most likely to be good.
